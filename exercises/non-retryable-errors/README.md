## Exercise #2: Defining Non-Retryable Errors Using Custom Retry Policies

During this exercise, you will:

- Configure non-retryable errors for Activities
- Implement customiz retry policies for Activities
- Develop Workflow logic for fallback strategies in the case of Activity failure
- Add Heartbeats and Heartbeat timeouts to help users monitor the health of Activities

Make your changes to the code in the `practice` subdirectory (look for
`TODO` comments that will guide you to where you should make changes to
the code). If you need a hint or want to verify your changes, look at
the complete version in the `solution` subdirectory.
